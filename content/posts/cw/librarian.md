Yes
Ensure you provide details and/or examples
Absolutely, as in my current job, a community worker, I often went beyond simply answering questions. I anticipated needs. For example, when a client mentioned he was struggling to read small text and that the app he used required payment and asked help, I offered to help. I assessed that I had around 15 minutes available and used that time to find a suitable free alternative. I installed the new app for him, explained how to use it, including how to save content and the daily usage limits, and guided him through trying it himself. He left confident and grateful, and I was glad to have made a real difference.

I enjoy building rapport and ensuring people feel heard and supported, which I believe is at the heart of great library service.
