A serial module is an add-on to an LMS and can manage subscriptions to serials.
The serial module provides:
	•	Subscription management, including frequency adding/editing, which determines how often the library receives issues and how many issues the library gets.
	•	Serial numbering patterns editing, which defines the customizable serial pattern; it can be related to day, month, year, volume, number, or any custom numbers.
	•	Adding/Editing subscriptions: choose from a selected vendor (from the acquisitions module or by vendor ID) and add the record (use a unique ID for the serial, for example, the biblionumber of the MARC record when using Koha LMS).
	•	Receiving issues: use an action button to change the status of a serial; it can be Arrived, Late, Missing, etc. There is also a bulk editing page for each subscription.
	•	Allows patrons and library staff to see the serial subscription status, including frequency, start/end date, and availability.
	•	Optional routing list, which is a list to pass on before the serial goes to the shelf. For example, it can include specific doctors who need to read a medical serial before the issue goes to the public.

Some common serial statuses are:
	•	Expected – while we are under the waiting period for its arrival.
	•	Arrived – confirming it is in the library’s possession.
	•	Circulating – while it is circulating through a routing list.
	•	Bound – when it is bound.
	•	Late – when it is past the estimated waiting time.
	•	Missing – can have reasons behind it, such as never received or damaged.
	•	Claimed – means the issue has not arrived, but a claim was sent to the vendor.



  Self-Serve Kiosk
A Self-Serve Kiosk is an add-on hardware module that can be integrated with a Learning Management System to streamline user access and automate administration functions. It allows patrons to lend materials with the minimum help from the staff. Typically, it has a touchscreen with a barcode reader, a RFID reader and a small receipt printer.
It can take a couple minutes plus the time to line up to get service from library staff before introducing the automated kiosks to libraries. In the early days, we use Barcode and Magnetic Strip Systems. It speeds up the process by scanning each items within a blink of eyes.
The technology keeps improving and we have RFID, which is a label sticker stick in library resources. The RFID reader in the kiosk can scan through the multiple items at once without the need to show RFID stickers in sight. As costs fell and standards matured, it is available and affordable for almost all libraries that are introducing Self-Serve Kiosk system.
