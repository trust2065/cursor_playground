create a record system that records
working time, from and to
break time, type 1, 15 minutes that is no pay and type 2 that has payment

and can calculate the total working time

rules - 
1. if working time has gap less than 1 hr, it count as continuous time
2. break time type 1 is no pay
3. break time type 2 has same pay
4. if two works has more than 1 hr gap, add an allowance

I have some payments and shifts and I need you to verify if that all follows the rule. Otherwise, please let me know if any rules is wrong - could be my misunderstanding
