A serial module is an add-on to an LMS and can manage subscriptions to serials.
The serial module provides:
	•	Subscription management, including frequency adding/editing, which determines how often the library receives issues and how many issues the library gets.
	•	Serial numbering patterns editing, which defines the customizable serial pattern; it can be related to day, month, year, volume, number, or any custom numbers.
	•	Adding/Editing subscriptions: choose from a selected vendor (from the acquisitions module or by vendor ID) and add the record (use a unique ID for the serial, for example, the biblionumber of the MARC record when using Koha LMS).
	•	Receiving issues: use an action button to change the status of a serial; it can be Arrived, Late, Missing, etc. There is also a bulk editing page for each subscription.
	•	Allows patrons and library staff to see the serial subscription status, including frequency, start/end date, and availability.
	•	Optional routing list, which is a list to pass on before the serial goes to the shelf. For example, it can include specific doctors who need to read a medical serial before the issue goes to the public.

Some common serial statuses are:
	•	Expected – while we are under the waiting period for its arrival.
	•	Arrived – confirming it is in the library’s possession.
	•	Circulating – while it is circulating through a routing list.
	•	Bound – when it is bound.
	•	Late – when it is past the estimated waiting time.
	•	Missing – can have reasons behind it, such as never received or damaged.
	•	Claimed – means the issue has not arrived, but a claim was sent to the vendor.
