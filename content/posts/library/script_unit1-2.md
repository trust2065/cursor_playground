Hi how are you, my name is Choco, I'm a library assistant.
Welcome to the library, how can I assist you today?

Customer:
Hi, my name is Ann, I had trouble borrowing items from the kiosk, it shows 'Fine Limit Exceeded'. 

Staff:
Thank you for letting me know, Ann.
May I have your library card please.

Customer:
Surely, is digital one ok?

Yeah sure, give me one second.
I've checked your account records and I can see there are 2 outstanding fees.
The first fee is an unpaid reservation charge, when reserve book online the library will charge a small amount of fee for the labour work.
And the second is a replacement fee for a damaged copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

Customer:
Oh really, how do you recognise if the item is damaged? It was in the that condition when I borrowed it, and it looked the same to me when I returned it.

Staff:
Let me have a closer look at the record.
In general, when items are returned, our staff carefully check them against the condition notes that were made at the time of lending.
If there are additional markings, missing pages, or other visible damage, these are recorded.
In this case, our records show the copy you returned had damage that was not previously noted.
And there were 2 pages that are missing when we received the book.
Does this explanation make sense to you, or would you like me to show you the notes in the system?

Customer:
Okay, would you clarify how much I owed?

Staff:
Of course. Here is a breakdown of your charges:
	•	Unpaid reservation charge: $3
	•	Replacement fee for the damaged copy: $18

That brings your total to $21.
Here's also a copy of our library service fees flyer, which lists common charges such as reservation fees, late returns, and replacement costs.

Customer:
It's the first time this happens to me, and I always return items on time. Is there a way I can resolve this instead of paying the fine?

Staff:
I understand this must feel frustrating, especially since you've always been punctual with returns.
For the reservation charge, unfortunately there is no way to avoid it, you'll need to pay it.
As for the replacement fee, in some cases it can be waived but I am not the one with the authority. I will refer your case to our senior management, and our supervisor will be in contact with you within 48 hours to discuss with you and to confirm whether the fee can be waived.
In the meantime, you do have the option to pay the minimum $3 fee, that will make the owing amount to $18, which is under the fine limit $20, and will unlock your card so you can continue borrowing today.

Customer:
Ok great, one more question, are there ways I can get notifications before the returning dates?

Staff:
Yes, absolutely. By default, we send email reminders 3 days before items are due.
There is also an optional SMS reminders, I'm happy to set it up for you, just provide your mobile number and we'll activate that service.

Customer:
Great, I will think about it. As for now, I would like to make the minimum payment today with my credit card.

Staff:
No problem. You will be paying the reservation fee which is $3. Please tap your card when you're ready.

Customer:
(Beep)

Staff:
Perfect, your card has been unlocked, and you should be able to borrow items now.
We'll also follow up with you tomorrow by phone to make sure there are no further issues.
Thank you for your patience, Ann, and have a great evening.

Customer:
Thank you for your help.

Staff:
You're very welcome.
