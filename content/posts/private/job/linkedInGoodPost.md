ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone!

Iâ€™m currently looking for new opportunities as a Senior Frontend Engineer (Remote preferred) â€” ideally working with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve been focused on building clean, scalable UIs, improving developer workflows, and contributing to modern stack transitions (like Redux â†’ Zustand + React Query). I care a lot about performance, clean code, and creating great user experiences.

If your team is hiring remotely or you know someone who is, Iâ€™d love to connect and chat!
